## 5.1 User Demographics for All Loan Ads
To set the stage for our analysis, we first characterize who is seeing loan ads on Meta. As shown in Figure 1, among 269 loan ads we filtered out, male users—particularly older men—appear to be more heavily targeted. Specifically, 16.4% of viewers are males aged 55–64, and 15.7% are males over 65. However, this pattern may be misleading. Given that Meta as a platform has a larger base of male users overall, it is expected that male users would naturally make up a larger share of ad impressions—regardless of the ad type. Therefore, raw exposure percentages alone are insufficient to determine targeting bias, highlighting the need for normalization across demographic baselines.

### 4.2 Rationale for Dual-Model Approach:
To explore the prevalence of harmful and fraudulent loan ads, we initially applied a straightforward classifier (facebook/bart-large-mnli model) that flags each ad as “fraud” (1) or “non-fraud” (0) based on a single dummy variable. However, this model wasn’t designed specifically for nuanced fraud detection. Thus, to strengthen our findings, we then leveraged another powerful LLM fine-tuned on multiple fraud and harm labels(e.g., fake government grants, currency exchange risk, high APR), allowing us to capture a broader spectrum of deceptive tactics. By comparing outputs from both systems, we cross-validate our findings and mitigate the risks associated with relying on any single “black-box” algorithm—ultimately strengthening the credibility and depth of our analysis

## 5.3 Model One: Harmful and Fraudulent Loan Labels
### 1.	Frequency of Loss‑Related Labels
Building on our demographics overview, we next quantify how often risky loan ads occur, applying the mDeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-xnli model—fine-tuned on 11 fraud-related labels—to a large corpus of loan ads. Our goal was to flag those offers most likely to inflict financial loss or exploit vulnerable consumers. After running the model, we identified 93 loan ads as harmful or fraudulent accounting for 34.6% of all loan ads, suggesting they carried one or more loss labels.
Out of 93 harmful loan ads detected, we focused on the five most frequent loss labels (Figure 2)—currency exchange risk (49 ads), instant loans (22), fake government grants (20), false loan guarantees (2), and high APR (1). To assess whether certain demographic groups are disproportionately exposed to these risks, we then computed a normalized exposure ratio for each group, comparing their exposure to each specific risk label against their overall exposure to loan-related ads.
