In today’s increasingly complex digital financial environment, the boundary between financial fraud and financial risk is becoming increasingly blurred. These two issues often overlap, posing significant threats to consumer financial security and undermining market fairness. In academic literature, **financial fraud** is commonly defined as **_a deliberate act of deception aimed at obtaining illicit gains through the manipulation of information or exploitation of system vulnerabilities_** (Button et al., 2014). However, there remains no consistent academic consensus on how to define specific types of fraud. As a result, the classification and identification of financial risks in practice are often shaped by the categorizations and warnings issued by government regulatory agencies. 

For instance, the New York State Department of Financial Services classifies **high-risk financial products** into several types of predatory loans and loan scams, including _payday loans_, _tax refund anticipation loans_, _advance fee loan scams_, and _government grant loan scams_. These products are frequently marketed using language such as **_“instant approval”_** or **_“no credit check,”_** yet they are commonly associated with extremely **_high annual percentage rates (APRs)_**, **_false promises_**, **_identity theft_**, and **_upfront payment scams_**. Similarly, the European Financial Inclusion Network Working Group on Over-Indebtedness (2016) defines **unfair lending practices** as those that **_involve a lack of creditworthiness assessment or inadequate disclosure of key terms_**, and identifies **_payday loans_** and **_foreign currency loans_** as “toxic loans” due to their high costs and currency fluctuation risks, which can easily trap borrowers in long-term cycles of default.

In terms of risk identification and consumer protection, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) highlights the need to be especially cautious of high-risk features hidden in loan agreements, such as **_prepayment penalties_**, **_balloon payments_**, **_negative amortization_**, and **_interest-only structures_**. These features may lead to unexpected costs during the loan term and increase the likelihood of borrower default. The CFPB advises borrowers to inquire about the necessity of these features and request alternative loan offers without such terms in order to compare costs and assess risk more accurately (CFPB, n.d.).

In the field of financial risk and fraud detection, machine learning techniques have been widely used to identify fraudulent behavior in large-scale datasets. Almarhabi et al. (2023) applied supervised machine learning methods—including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes to detect cryptocurrency fraud in the U.S. context, with the Random Forest model achieving near-perfect accuracy. However, their approach heavily relies on pre-labeled data and is therefore limited to detecting known fraud patterns. It struggles to identify novel or more covert forms of fraud. Moreover, the study focused solely on structured transactional data and did not address natural language processing (NLP) tasks, making it unsuitable for analyzing risky language in advertising or social media, especially in multilingual contexts.

Similarly, Rana et al. (2022) employed a pre-trained BERT language model to detect fraudulent job postings and achieved outstanding performance under a supervised learning setting (with an F1-score of 0.93). While their model benefited from BERT’s strong contextual understanding, it still required extensive human-labeled data for fine-tuning, which limits its applicability to emerging or subtle fraud schemes. Furthermore, since their dataset consisted of structured recruitment texts, the model lacked adaptability to unstructured advertising content and did not support multilingual analysis—factors essential to our study on cross-language ad-based risk detection.

Kuo and Tsang (2024) proposed a hybrid approach combining emotion analysis with supervised learning to identify investment scams. They extracted emotional fluctuation features across different scam lifecycle stages from Chinese chatroom data and applied classifiers such as Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Random Tree. Although their findings demonstrated a strong correlation between emotional trajectories and scam-related language, the model’s dependence on a predefined Chinese emotion lexicon and structured dialogue data limits its ability to generalize to multilingual, semantically complex advertising texts. As such, it is not applicable to our research objectives.

By contrast, the **zero-shot classification** pipeline, a cutting-edge method in NLP, offers a promising solution to the challenge of limited labeled data (Yin et al., 2019). As an advanced form of deep transfer learning, it enables cross-task text classification without requiring additional supervised training, by leveraging language and task knowledge learned through Natural Language Inference (NLI). In this study, we adopt Microsoft’s multilingual **mDeBERTa model** (released in 2021), which was pre-trained on CC100 and fine-tuned on MNLI and XNLI datasets. It supports semantic reasoning across more than 100 languages, making it well-suited to the analysis of digital ads in highly multilingual environments.

> We apply this zero-shot pipeline to analyze loan-related advertisements from Meta’s ad library, detecting financial risk content without the need for labeled training data.

Its premise–hypothesis structure mimics human reasoning and aligns with value-based analytical frameworks commonly used in the social sciences. This makes it especially effective for identifying value-laden textual content such as financial scams, misleading promotions, and emotional manipulation. Moreover, the model’s adaptability to diverse languages and complex text formats positions it as a highly efficient and flexible tool for financial risk detection across low-resource, heterogeneous digital media platforms.

Here's a table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |

You can use [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to write LaTeX expressions. For example:
When \\(a \ne 0\\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://beautifuljekyll.com/assets/img/crepe.jpg)

It can also be centered!

![Crepe](https://beautifuljekyll.com/assets/img/crepe.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.

## Local URLs in project sites {#local-urls}

When hosting a *project site* on GitHub Pages (for example, `https://USERNAME.github.io/MyProject`), URLs that begin with `/` and refer to local files may not work correctly due to how the root URL (`/`) is interpreted by GitHub Pages. You can read more about it [in the FAQ](https://beautifuljekyll.com/faq/#links-in-project-page). To demonstrate the issue, the following local image will be broken **if your site is a project site:**

![Crepe](/assets/img/crepe.jpg)

If the above image is broken, then you'll need to follow the instructions [in the FAQ](https://beautifuljekyll.com/faq/#links-in-project-page). Here is proof that it can be fixed:
